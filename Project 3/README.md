📝 Blockchain To-Do List

A simple to-do list manager built on top of a blockchain concept.
Each task you add becomes a block in the chain, linked by cryptographic hashes.

This ensures tasks are tamper-proof and chronologically ordered—a fun way to learn blockchain basics!

🚀 Features

Add new tasks as blocks in the blockchain

View all tasks stored securely in the chain

Validate the blockchain’s integrity (detects tampering)

Interactive menu-based interface (no external libraries needed)

📂 File

todo_blockchain.py — main script with Block and Blockchain classes

▶️ How to Run
# Run with Python 3
python todo_blockchain.py

🖥️ Example Usage
===== Blockchain To-Do List =====
1. Add a new task
2. View all tasks
3. Validate blockchain
4. Exit


Choose 1 → Enter your task (it becomes a block)

Choose 2 → View your to-do blockchain

Choose 3 → Verify if blockchain is valid

Choose 4 → Exit
