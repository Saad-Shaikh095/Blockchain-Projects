## 🗳️ Blockchain Voting System (Python)

A simple Blockchain-based Voting System written in Python.
Each vote is stored as a block, linked by cryptographic hashes, ensuring transparency and preventing tampering.
It also prevents double voting using a voter ID system.

✨ Features

🔗 Blockchain with SHA-256 hashing

⛏️ Proof-of-Work mining (configurable difficulty)

✅ Prevents double voting (tracks unique voter IDs)

📊 Real-time vote tallying

🔍 Blockchain validation

🖥️ Interactive menu for casting votes and viewing results

📂 File Structure

voting_blockchain.py → Main script containing the blockchain and voting logic.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Blockchain-Projects.git
cd Blockchain-Projects


Run the program:

python voting_blockchain.py

📖 Usage

When you run the program, you’ll see an interactive menu:

--- Voting Blockchain ---
1. Cast a vote
2. Show results
3. Print blockchain
4. Exit

Example Run
Enter choice: 1
Enter your voter ID: voter1
Enter candidate name: Alice
✅ Vote mined: voter1 -> Alice

Enter choice: 1
Enter your voter ID: voter2
Enter candidate name: Bob
✅ Vote mined: voter2 -> Bob

Enter choice: 2
📊 Current Results: {'Alice': 1, 'Bob': 1}

🔑 Blockchain Concepts in This Project

Hash: Each block has a unique SHA-256 hash based on its content.

Nonce & Difficulty: Mining requires finding a hash starting with 00.

Previous Hash: Ensures blocks are linked in order, preventing tampering.

Genesis Block: The very first block that starts the chain.

Validation: Chain is checked for integrity before counting votes.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This is an educational project.
It demonstrates blockchain fundamentals in a voting scenario.
It is not secure or scalable enough for real-world elections.
